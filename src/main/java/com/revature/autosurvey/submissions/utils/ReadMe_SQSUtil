### Messaging Queues for Submissions SQS ###
Used for decoupling interactions between Analytics --> Surveys & Submissions with
DB access.

## Features and Usage (Backend) ##
* Analytics can initiate a request to Submissions by wrapping a Including UUID, 
batch and date parameters in a JSON message then sending to the Submissions Queue 
on AWS (https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/855430746673/SubmissionQueue).
* Submissions queue listener receives the message (when service is up) and 
queries the database on behalf of analytics. 
* Submissions service sends a response back to the Analytics queue on 
AWS (https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/855430746673/AnalyticsQueue) as a list 
of response to all surveys found based on query:

## S3 Exception ##
If the message payload of compiled responses exceeds 256KB, the message will have
to be stored in S3 for retrieval at the later date. Review
